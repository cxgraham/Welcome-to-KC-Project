# Welcome-to-KC-Project

Welcome to Kansas City is a community/blog personal project that allows visitors to view what, in my opinion, are the top five places to eat,
top five activities and top five bars and clubs. Visitors can view all of the information on the site, but must create an acccount in order to leave a comment.
I wanted to create this to celebrate my hometown, Kansas City, and also to work more on styling.

On the main page of the site, you can view each blog/community post without having to create an account.

However, if you want to leave a comment, you are given a notice to create an account.

The login and create account links in the nav bar both link you to the same page to either log into your account or create an account.

Once logged in, the navigation bar at the top now gives you the option to view your dashboard or logout.

Since you are logged in, you can leave a comment about your experience! It also gives you the option to edit or delete the comment, but the option only shows for comments you created.

When you view your dashboard, you are able to view all of the comments you left and which page you left them on. You also have the option to view, edit or delete the comment.
Clicking view takes you to the page where the comment was left. The edit button takes you to a separate screen to edit the comment and then takes you back to 
your dashboard once updated. You are also given the option to upload a profile/avatar photo!
