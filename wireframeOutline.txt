[REQUIRED] Project Description: The product is going to be a “Welcome to Kansas City Guide” that I will include my top five restaurants, bars, things to do, but more catered to people my age. Visitors will also be able to create an account and leave comments on each “blog post” about their experiences at the listed places or if they have had great experiences somewhere else. I currently live in downtown Kansas City and think this would be something cool to showcase where I live.
